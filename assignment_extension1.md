Instructions for setting up github [here](https://gist.github.com/clearf/5961089)

* Extend yesterday's todo assignment. 
* Add Contacts and the ability to assign multiple contacts to a task 
   * use has_and_belongs_to_many
   * Add to your tasks controller so that you can add an existing contact to a task
    * (Hint: use an "option" dropdown menu)
   * When you add a new person to a task, check to make sure you're not duplciating them.
* Do basic crud stuff for contacts. Don't go crazy!
* To be explicit:
  * Tasks can have many people
  * People can have many tasks
